# Why this CLI?

CLI for Microsoft 365 is a cross-platform CLI that allows users on any platform to manage various configuration settings of Microsoft 365.

- CLI for Microsoft 365 offers a variety of commands from many different areas of Microsoft 365 like: [SharePoint Online](../cmd/spo/spo-get), [Teams](../cmd/teams/app/app-install), [Viva engage](../cmd/viva/engage/engage-search), [Entra](../cmd/entra/administrativeunit/administrativeunit-add), [Power Apps](../cmd/pa/app/app-export), [Power Automate](../cmd/flow/flow-disable), [Power Platform](../cmd/pp/aibuildermodel/aibuildermodel-get), [OneDrive](../cmd/onedrive/onedrive-list), [Planner](../cmd/planner/bucket/bucket-add), [OneNote](../cmd/onenote/notebook/notebook-add), [Outlook](../cmd/outlook/mail/mail-send), [SharePoint Embedded](../cmd/spe/containertype/containertype-add) and many more.
- Intuitive! If you would like to `add` a new `SharePoint Online` `list` simply write `m365 spo list add` and if you need to do a different action like modifying the list or retrieving it simply change the verb to: `get`, `set`, `remove` etc. 
- Interactive by default. Starting to use a new CLI is never easy, that's why CLI for Microsoft 365 offers an interactive mode that actively asks (prompts) you for the required options of a command you want to run. You may also [configure autocomplete for commands](../user-guide/completion.mdx) and options that you're typing in the prompt for almost any terminal.
- [Different `output` modes](../user-guide/cli-output-mode.mdx) allow you to choose how you want to see the results of your commands. You can choose between `json` which is perfect to be used in a script when output of one command will be used as an input to other command, `text` which is perfect for human reading and `csv` or even `md` (markdown) which is perfect to create a report based outcome.
- Integrates everywhere. CLI for Microsoft 365 was created based on Node.js technologies which allows you to run it on any device and in any shell.
- [Manage SharePoint Framework solutions](../cmd/spfx/spfx-doctor). CLI for Microsoft 365 will help you setup your local environment for SPFx development and will help you with common tasks when developing SPFx solutions, like validating its correctness or getting guidance on how to upgrade it.
- Make [CLI for Microsoft 365 your own](../user-guide/configuring-cli). CLI for Microsoft 365 offers a variety of settings that will allow you to customize it for your specific use case or needs. If going over the settings is challenging, then you will love the [m365 setup](../cmd/setup) command that will help you customize CLI for common use cases like setting it to be tailored to be run in a script.
- AI, Of course we have an AI! CLI for Microsoft 365 comes along with an [AI assistant chili üå∂Ô∏è](../user-guide/chili) that will help you find the right commands for your tasks.
- You may use it in CI/CD pipelines. It integrates easily with Azure DevOps and natively with GitHub workflows. CLI has dedicated [GitHub actions](../user-guide/github-actions) which you may use directly in GitHub workflow and it allows you to scaffold a pipeline for [Azure DevOps](../cmd/spfx/project/project-azuredevops-pipeline-add) and [GitHub workflows](../cmd/spfx/project/project-github-workflow-add).
- How many CLI's allows you to run it as your API in an app? That is what I though. [CLI for Microsoft 365 may be used as an API](../user-guide/use-cli-api) in your Node.js app.
- You may filter and sort the output of every command. [Filtering and sorting](../user-guide/filter-cli-data.mdx) is a powerful feature that allows you to get only the data you need and in the order you want.
